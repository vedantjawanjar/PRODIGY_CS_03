This code represents one of my task from my Internship at Prodigy Infotech. It is a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, 
presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 
It Provide feedback to users on the password's strength.
Password strength is a measure of the effectiveness of a password against guessing or brute-force attacks. 
In its usual form, it estimates how many trials an attacker who does not have direct access to the password would need, on average, to guess it correctly.

************** WORKING OF PROGRAM ***************
After executing the program, it ask user to enter password.
once user enters the password it calculate and give the rating on, how strong password is.
